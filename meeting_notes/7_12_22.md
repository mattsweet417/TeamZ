# Meeting Notes
## 12 July 2022

### Meeting with Team D
#### MeetEng
* Team D has essentially same overall implementation but much more high level

#### Search Engine (Crwaling Team)
 * Receive (JSON?) document unit from crawling (url id and list of links)
	``` json
	{
		"id" : "HTTPS://URLOFDOCUMENT",
		"links": {
			"1" : "HTTPS://URL1",
			"2" : "HTTPS://URL2",
			"3" : "HTTPS://URL3",
			// ...
		}
	}
	```
 * Return confirmation, no other real return of information
 * Maybe crawling needs to access document data store to keep track of what they've already crawled, it will not be useful for them to use the web graph for this purpose

### Further MeetEng Design Discussion Internally
 * Overall object-oriented approach for everything (user profiles, instance of a meeting)
 * Nofitification system
	* Relatively simply, just pushes email/text message to contact info
 * Matching algorithm
	* Initial separate groups of student profiles by major
	* Search through those profiles
 * User creation
	* Users saved in database (Mongo DB?)
 * Data analysis
	* Same stats process that Val has been making at the end of every admissions season
